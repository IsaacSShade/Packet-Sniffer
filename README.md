# Packet-Sniffer
This was my first attempt at sniffing packets. I coded up a sniffer that unpacks IPv4 headers and tells you where they're sent from, headed to, and the protocol used.
All code I wrote was in the .py file, everything else was from using the pyinstaller and I was unsure if that was needed for someone to download and use.

## Instructions for Use:
1. Run CMD with admin priviliges
2. Open executable file within the dist folder
